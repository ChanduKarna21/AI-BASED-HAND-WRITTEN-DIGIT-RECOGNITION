Hand Written Digit Recognition

Handwritten digit recognition is the process of automatically recognizing digits that are written by hand. This task is typically accomplished through the use of machine learning algorithms, which are trained on a large dataset of handwritten digits and then used to classify new, unseen digits.

The process of recognizing handwritten digits typically involves several steps. First, the input image is preprocessed to enhance its quality and reduce noise. This may involve techniques such as filtering, binarization, and edge detection.

Next, features are extracted from the image that can be used to differentiate between different digits. These features may include aspects such as the shape of the digit, the presence of loops or curves, and the thickness of the lines.

Once the features have been extracted, a machine learning algorithm is used to classify the digit. This algorithm may be a simple classification model, such as a k-nearest neighbors or a support vector machine, or a more complex neural network model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN).

The performance of a handwritten digit recognition system can be measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. These metrics are used to evaluate how well the system is able to correctly identify digits in a given dataset.

Applications of handwritten digit recognition include optical character recognition (OCR) systems, which are used to digitize and process written documents, as well as various computer vision applications, such as identifying handwritten addresses on envelopes.
